# gluestack-ui-flutter (alpha)

**gluestack-ui-flutter** is a universal UI library that provides optionally styled and accessible widgets. These widgets are designed for easy integration into applications developed with Flutter.

## Documentation

You can try out the gluestack flutter widgets on this storybook link: https://gluestack-ui-example.web.app/#/storybook

Web app build with gluestack: https://kitchensink-23184.web.app/

We are referring gluestack-ui to create gluestack-ui-flutter. Flutter documentation is in progress. You can find the detailed documentation for each component, including a list of props and examples, in https://gluestack.io/ui/docs website.

## Features

- **Customizable widgets:** Each widget in the library comes with a set of customizable props that allow you to tailor its appearance and behavior to your specific needs.

- **Declarative and Dynamic Styling:** By using JSON for style configurations, you're enabling a more declarative approach to UI design. This can be particularly powerful when styles need to be changed dynamically or loaded from external sources.

- **Web-focus:** While Material and Cupertino excel on mobile, gluestack-ui could be tailored for web experiences, offering components and styles optimized for desktop interaction and layout. Think responsive design, mouse hover interactions, and web-specific UI patterns.

- **Flexibility for Developers:** Providing inline style overrides gives developers the flexibility to quickly customize components on a case-by-case basis, without the need to alter the JSON configuration for minor tweaks.

- **Responsive design:** The widgets are built using modern web design principles and are fully responsive, so they work seamlessly across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

- **Well-documented:** The comes with comprehensive documentation for each widget, including a list of props and examples, to help you get up and running quickly.

- **Easy to use:** The widgets are designed to be easy to use and integrate into your existing Flutter applications. Simply install the library and import the widgets you need.

- **Frequent updates:** We are constantly working on improving the library and adding new widgets. Follow us on GitHub to stay up-to-date on the latest releases and features.

- **Community support:** Need help using the library or have a suggestion for a new feature? Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/95qQ84nf6f) channel to connect with the community and get support.

## Installation

```bash
flutter pub add gluestack_ui
```

## Usage

Wrap the MaterialApp with GluestackProvider.

```dart

GluestackProvider(
  child: MaterialApp.router(
    ....
)
```

Here's an example of how to use GSButton widget into your flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:gluestack_ui/gluestack_ui.dart';

GSButton(
  action: GSActions.negative,
  variant: GSVariants.solid,
  size: GSSizes.$lg,
  onPressed: () {},
  style: GSStyle(
    web: GSStyle(
      bg: $GSColors.amber600,
    ),
    ios: GSStyle(
      bg: $GSColors.pink600,
    ),
    onHover: GSStyle(
      bg: $GSColors.green400,
    ),
    md: GSStyle(
      bg: $GSColors.pink400,
    ),
  ),
  child: const GSButtonText(text: "Click Here"),
)
```

All Gluestack widgets support dark theme. Package detects the current theme from Flutter's inbuilt Theme.of(context).brightness. Hence, you can manage the theme mode from MaterialApp itself using the state management of your choice.

## Customize tokens via token config

You can customize the default tokens to provide your own design values.

```dart

GluestackProvider(
  gluestackTokenConfig: GluestackTokenConfig(
    gsColorsToken: const GSColorsToken(
      primary600: Colors.pink,
      primary700: Colors.pink,
    ),
    gsFontSizeToken: const GSFontSizeToken(
      $sm: 12,
      $md: 14,
    ),
    // More token configurations....
  ),
  child: MaterialApp.router(
    ....
  ),
)

```

## Providing custom Widget Config

We have build the widgets from Figma config file. In case you want to customise the default values provided by the package for individual widgets, you can specify your own configuration for the widgets.

> **NOTE:** Format of the configuration must be same as the own used by Gluestack internally. For example, for button please refer to the default config file for GSButton.

Below example provides custom configuration for GSButton widget.

```dart

// Example of button configuration.

const Map<String, dynamic> customButtonConfig = {
  ...
  '_dark': {
    'bg': '\$primary400',
    'borderColor': '\$primary700',
    ':hover': {
      'bg': '\$error300',
      'borderColor': '\$primary400',
    }
  }
  ...
};


GluestackProvider(
  gluestackCustomConfig: GluestackCustomConfig(
    button: customButtonConfig,
    buttonText: customButtonTextConfig,
    ...
  ),
  gluestackTokenConfig: GluestackTokenConfig(...),
  child: MaterialApp.router(
    ...
  ),
)

```

## Future Scope

- **Omitting Material Dependency:** Developers can tailor the UI components to fit the exact needs and aesthetics of their applications without being restricted to Material Design standards. From performance improvement respective, by building a system independent of Material Design, you might optimize performance, especially for applications that require lightweight and fast-loading interfaces.

- **Enhanced Widget Configuration:** The widgets will be designed in a modular fashion, allowing users to plug in different components or features as needed. This modular approach enables more complex and varied widget compositions.With more control over the widget design, developers can create applications that offer a better user experience, tailored to their target audience.

- **Configurable Token System:** Design the token system to be scalable and customizable. Users should be able to add new tokens or modify existing ones to suit their project needs.
